# NAB_rules
This repo is used to display a static web page for graphical representation of the rules used to filter bird reports when genertating the Ontario regional reports for North American Birds. 

The code used to perform the filtering can be found [here](https://github.com/Ontario-NAB/NAB-filter).

## Contributing a Rules Change
There are a few ways to contribute a rules change. The most direct is to contact the Ontario regional compilers (the emails can be found on any Ontario report, a list of which are linked on the site). The other ways are to open an issue or open a PR against the json file in this repository.
